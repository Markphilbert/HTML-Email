A Clone of an Email Advertisement I recieved in my gmail promotions. All links work and redirect to the actual company site.

This project is hosted on Netlify.

<h3>Description</h3>

This was created using HTML Table Formatting for the sole purpose of picking up and learning tables. I went through the promotions tab on my gmail account and chose the email that looked most complicated to me and I replicated it.

<h3>How It's Made:</h3>

This Project was created with: 
<ul>
<li>Use of HTML Table Formatting</li>
<li>Use of Inline CSS Styling</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

Through creating this project I learned how tables work. This was also my first time replicating a site from a photo so it was a big learning experience in both learning inline CSS styling but also just learning positioning with CSS.
